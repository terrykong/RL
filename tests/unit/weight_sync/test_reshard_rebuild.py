"""Recovering the nccl_reshard transport, and the refit dispatch both transports share.

Two failures are pinned here, both silent rather than loud:

* The refit plan is a function of the inference world size. Reusing one built for the
  old fleet does not error -- a stale mesh is still a valid mesh -- it just has survivors
  writing the slices the dead shard owned and leaving their own unwritten.
* Rebuilding the communicator is only half a recovery. The refit *dispatch* walks the
  worker group, so without excluding the dead shard the next sync still calls its actor.
