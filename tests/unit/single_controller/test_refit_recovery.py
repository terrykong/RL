"""Recovering the refit after a generation shard dies during or around it.

Two distinct failures land on this path, and job 5925668 hit one with each variant of
the functional test:

``RefitAborted``    a rank went silent inside the collective and a worker's watchdog
                    broke it. Survivors hold partial weights.
``RayActorError``   the collective completed and the shard died before its RPC
                    returned. Survivors hold complete weights.

What the tests here pin down is the ordering that made the first attempt fail on real
hardware: the repair has to establish who is gone *itself*, rather than reading a health
monitor whose verdict arrives on a probe schedule.
