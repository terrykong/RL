# SIGKILL one of two vLLM generation shards mid-run and assert the job RECOVERS:
# training continues to completion on the surviving shard, with the refit communicator
# rebuilt without the dead ranks.
#
# The inverse of grpo_dp_single_controller_chaos.sh. That one asserts a bounded, loud
# failure -- the P0 containment behaviour. This asserts the P3 behaviour: not stopping
# cleanly, but carrying on.
#
# WHY THIS NEEDS >= 3 GPUs, and why it is a CI test rather than a workstation one.
# Recovery is only observable when losing a shard still leaves a fleet, so generation
# needs dp_size >= 2 (2 GPUs at tp=1) plus at least one trainer. On a 2-GPU box the
# only possible split is 1 trainer + 1 generation shard, and killing that shard leaves
# nothing to recover onto -- the run can only fail, which tests the P0 path again
# rather than this one. The script self-skips below that threshold instead of
# pretending to pass.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/functional/grpo_sc_generation_shard_recovery.sh
#   NUM_GPUS=8 bash tests/functional/grpo_sc_generation_shard_recovery.sh

# training GPU count. Taking every remaining GPU therefore breaks on common host sizes:

#   4 GPUs -> dp=2   512 %  8 = 0   ok
