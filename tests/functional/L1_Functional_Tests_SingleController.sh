#
# gen_kl_error is the assertion that earns its keep here: it compares vLLM's logprobs
# against the trainer's recomputation, so a proxy that corrupts or truncates a response
# blows it up. A run that merely completes would not prove the payload survived the hop.

# ...and the property that run CANNOT prove. It is dp_size=1, so _pick_backend has one
# choice, the serving set never shrinks, and the no-healthy-backend path never fires: it
# demonstrates pass-through, not failover. This one runs two generation shards, kills one
# mid-run, and asserts the serving set shrinks so NeMo-Gym stops being handed the corpse.

# EXPECT defaults to quarantine deliberately. Surviving the loss needs the communicator
# rebuild that lands later in this stack -- without it the next refit broadcasts to the
# dead rank and hangs in NCCL (job 6258553 sat there for 33 minutes). Asserting survival
# here would assert a property this part does not implement.

# ...and now the other half, which only this part of the stack can satisfy. Same kill,
# but the run must CONTINUE: reconcile_communicator rebuilds the refit group over the
# survivors, so the broadcast no longer addresses the rank that died. Before this, that
# refit hung inside NCCL and the run wedged with the stall watchdog warning -- quarantine
# without recovery (job 6258553).

#
# Deliberately alongside the chaos test above, not instead of it: that one asserts a
# bounded FAILURE on a fleet with nothing to fall back to, this one asserts SURVIVAL when
# a shard remains. Opposite behaviours, and a regression in either is invisible to the

# The same scenario with the kill placed INSIDE the refit collective rather than at a step
# boundary. That window is only ~10% of wall-clock, so the default variant reaches it by
# chance -- it both passed and wedged on consecutive runs of identical code. This is the
# only test that reliably exercises the abort-and-rebuild path.
run_test env KILL_DURING_REFIT=true uv run --no-sync bash ./tests/functional/grpo_sc_generation_shard_recovery.sh

#
# The two are not interchangeable. The collective path aborts one communicator; reshard
# holds TWO families -- the per-PP-stage bulk groups and the shared model_update_group --
# and a hang can be in either, so the watchdog is handed both and the rebuild has to
# regenerate the refit plan as well as the communicators. Nothing about that is exercised
# by the step-boundary variant above, which recovers between refits and never aborts.
#
# Without this, the reshard abort path had only signature assertions behind it: the
# deadline was plumbed and unit-tested, but no test had ever made a reshard refit
# actually abort on hardware.

# makes that test reproducible at all -- would otherwise silently drop a scenario the old,
# non-deterministic selection used to hit by chance. The two fail by different routes:
# killing an idle worker leaves the loss to be *detected*, killing a serving one destroys
# an in-flight RPC that surfaces at once (222s vs 12s when measured). A regression in
# either is invisible to the other.

# Cheap to add: the serving path fails in seconds, so this is dominated by startup.
