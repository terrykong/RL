        Idempotent, and safe on a group whose communicator was never built.

        **`abort()`, not `destroy()`, is the correct teardown here.** NCCL documents
        `destroy` as an intra-node collective that every rank must call or it hangs --
        precisely what a rank whose process has died cannot do. `abort` terminates
        outstanding operations instead, so it works whether or not the peers are alive,
        which makes it the only safe choice on a path that exists to handle dead peers.

        Verified on 2xA6000: with a peer SIGKILLed mid-broadcast, a survivor blocked in
        the collective was released 0.15s after another thread called abort().

        The rendezvous store is dropped too. Each rebuild gets a fresh port, so holding
        the old one costs nothing functionally, but a run that recovers repeatedly would
        otherwise accumulate a bound TCPStore per recovery for the life of the worker.
