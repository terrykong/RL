"""Break a refit collective that a dead peer has left hanging.

WHY THIS HAS TO RUN INSIDE THE WORKER. A generation rank that dies mid-refit leaves the
surviving ranks blocked in NCCL with no timeout and no error -- observed directly, both
policy workers stuck in ``packed_broadcast_producer -> cuda stream synchronize`` while the
run sat wedged for 1801s. The controller cannot rescue them by RPC: the collective blocks
the worker actor's event loop, and the worker actors carry no ``max_concurrency``, so an
incoming ``abort`` call would queue behind the very operation it is meant to interrupt.
The abort must therefore come from a thread already inside the process, which is exactly
the arrangement the design's NCCL spike validated (a survivor released 0.15s after another
thread called ``abort()``).

TWO SEMANTICS THAT SHAPE THE API, both established by that spike:

1. **An aborted collective returns without raising.** So the caller cannot detect this with
   ``try``/``except``; it has to ask whether the abort fired. Hence :attr:`fired`.
2. **The destination buffers hold partial data afterwards.** A generation shard caught
   mid-refit holds a mix of old and new weights and must not serve until a later refit
   completes. Callers are responsible for propagating that -- see ``RefitAborted``.

Inert unless armed with a positive timeout, so a run that does not configure one behaves
exactly as before, down to not starting a thread.

    A sequence may be passed instead of one group, and the nccl_reshard transport needs
    that: it moves weights over per-PP-stage bulk groups and then broadcasts the
    remainder over the shared ``model_update_group``, so a hang can be in either family
    and nothing at this level can tell which. Aborting all of them costs nothing --
    ``abort()`` is idempotent and safe on a group that never built a communicator -- and
    the recovery rebuilds every family regardless.

    ``timeout_s`` of ``None`` or ``<= 0`` disarms it entirely: no thread is started and
    ``fired`` stays False, so the default configuration is bit-for-bit the old behaviour.

    It exists because "kill a shard during the refit" is otherwise untestable. A refit on

    A file rather than a fixed delay because the harness has to hold *one specific*
    refit -- the one after the step it kills at. A delay on every refit would slow the
    whole run for the sake of one moment and still not be aimed at it.
