"""NCCL collective weight synchronizer for non-colocated deployments.

Handles weight transfer between policy and generation workers running on
separate GPU clusters using NCCL collective communication. The policy
broadcasts its weights, and generation workers receive them via the
established NCCL process group.

Lifecycle per sync:
  1. policy.broadcast_weights_for_collective()    -- send via NCCL
     generation.update_weights_from_collective()  -- receive via NCCL
  2. Verify transfer success

No offload/restore steps are needed since policy and generation run on
separate GPUs with dedicated memory.

        ``model_update_group`` spans every train and inference rank and was built once,

        missing rank blocks it forever -- inside NCCL, where it produces no error and no
        progress while Ray still reports every actor healthy. Rebuilding without the dead
        ranks is what lets the run continue.

        Safe for the broadcast because rank 0 is a trainer and trainers are never
        excluded, so the root is stable across a rebuild and each receiver still slices
        the same byte stream locally.

        Rebuild rather than ``shrink``: the pinned NCCL runtime exports
        ``ncclCommShrink`` but not ``ncclCommGrow``, so a shrunk world could never take a
        recovered engine back. One mechanism that works in both directions beats two that
